Twas bryllig and the slithy toves
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
All mimsy were the borogoves
and the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son.
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch.
Beware the Jubjub bird and shun...
the frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand, long time the manxome foe he sought.
So rested he by the Tumtum tree and stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Jabberwock with eyes of flame
came whiffling through the Tulgey wood and burbled as it came.

One-two! One-two! And through! And through!
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
he went gallumphing back.

And hast though slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
He chortled in his joy.
